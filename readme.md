# finite-element-analysis [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A currated list of open-source tools that facilitate using Galerkin techniques
> like finite element analysis to solve partial differential equations. 

This list is designed to complement the excellent
[finite-element-methods](https://github.com/tkoyama010/awesome-finite-elements) list,
which emphasizes applications to structural problems as well as pre- and post-processing.
